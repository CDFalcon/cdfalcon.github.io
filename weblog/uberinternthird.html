        <p><em>09/05/21</em></p>
        
        <p>This entry is the third and final of my Uber Intern ‘series’ in which I discuss my experiences as a software engineer intern at Uber.</p>
        <p>All in all, my time at Uber was excellent. The company is innovative, develops tech in a unique space, and has extremely high impact given its size. Leadership is steady under Dara and the company should reach profitability by the end of the year. Compensation was competitive and my return offer further so. Growth is also a plus, especially when compared to companies such as Google where lower level engineers struggle to progress past L4.</p>
        <p>A few specific thoughts and comparisons about Uber: as I mentioned in an earlier entry, the quantity and quality of the internal tooling pleasantly surprised me. The impact of the work I completed as a mere intern was extremely high: developing core pricing services for Eats which are utilized in every single Eats transaction - hundreds of millions per month! My team was supportive, reliable, and aided me in my growth as an engineer. While the internship was virtual, I was able to visit Uber’s new Mission Bay campus in SF which was fantastic – S-tier food, killer views, and perfect location. Honestly, I have no real complaints outside of the mandatory virtual setting and lower company moral this year, both due to COVID.</p>
        <p>Time will tell if I accept my intern return offer for next summer as I am examining all my options at the moment, but it is certainly a clear path forward if I chose to take it.</p>
