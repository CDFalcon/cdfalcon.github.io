        <p><em>08/14/24</em></p>
        
        <p><em>// disclaimer: I adore history - it has always been my favorite academic subject. This entry represents the start of my renewed effort to write and read more about history in my free time. One specific point to call out about this post however: I won’t be providing sources. Everything I claim below is easily verifiable with a few web searches, and I have no intention of polluting my passion with tedious side work.</em></p>
        <p>In 1935, Frank Deleno Roosevelt was rather concerned over a radical reformist’s rise to power. He called him one of the absolute most dangerous men in the world, one who threatened the foundations on which a great country had been constructed. Any guesses on who this man might be?</p>
        <p>Perhaps a young and rapidly ascending Adolf Hitler? Maybe a seasoned and ever dogmatic Joseph Stalin? The original founder of fascism, Benito Mussolini? The soon-to-be prime minister Winston Churchill? Possibly Emperor Hirohito, leader of a quickly modernizing Japan?</p>
        <p>None of the above. FDR was referring to an American named Huey Long, AKA the Kingfish. Now, FDR is considered a radical reformer in his own right. What about Huey, a Democratic Senator and ex-Governor of Louisiana of all states, was so alarming to the president?</p>
        <p>The Kingfish was populist in an age where fascism was considered a sexy new form of government. Many labeled him as such, but the term doesn’t do his ideas justice. Targeted reforms such as those he was proposing on a capitalist society had not been seen since the time of the Gracchi brothers in the late Roman Republic. Here’s a brief overview of his more controversial reforms which he proposed while Senator as part of his “Share Our Wealth” bills:</p>
        <ol><li>Personal fortunes above $100 million USD would be taxed at 100%. For every million above one million, taxes would increase by 1% up to 100%. Today, this would cap at ~$2.3 billion in USD.</li><li>A cap on annual income to be $1 million and inheritances to be $5 million - about $23 million and $120 million today, respectively.</li><li>A one time grant of $5,000 USD (~$120k today) to every US family, and annual Universal Basic Income (UBI) of $2-3,000 (~70k today) per family depending on need.</li><li>A mandated four day work week with minimum 4 weeks paid vacation.</Ii><li>any other reforms such as higher pensions (as opposed to FDR’s social security), free medical care for all citizens, and $10 billion (~$230 billion today) in funding devoted to fight off issues related to the Dust Bowl.</li></ol>
        <p>On top of these proposals, most of which are still controversial today, Huey maintained a positively flamboyant personality, bordering on buffoonery. In his first day on the Senate floor, he slapped an elderly senator on the back, jabbed another in the ribs, and loudly proclaimed that “the Kingfish had arrived”. All of course, while huffing his signature cigar. His personality, however, was merely an act which he utilized to divert attention from his authoritarian tendencies.</p>
        <p>Before becoming Senator, Huey ran his home state of Louisiana as a dictator from the role of Governor, controlling the media and courts with countless bribes and manipulation tactics. He viewed Lousiania State University in Baton Rouge as his own academy, expelling students who disagreed with him and using state troopers when necessary to enforce his demands. More impactfully, he had nearly total control over Louisiana’s state legislature: at home, he enjoyed immense popularity and passed bills with ease. Huey had complete contempt for the democratic process and openly bribed politicians and court justices whenever he needed to circumvent a troublesome rival.</p>
        <p>Unlike many other Southern demagogues at the time, the Kingfish did not run on a platform of racial superiority. In fact, he actively protested portions of FDR’s New Deal for their disproportionate effect on the Black citizens in Southern states. All of his policies focused on aiding the poor rural voters of Louisiana and reducing the power of the Southern aristocracy which had controlled regional politics for generations.</p>
        <p>Long’s greatest claim to fame during his time as Louisiana’s Governor was the fact he actually delivered on promises. He deployed sweeping upgrades to state infrastructure, opened night schools which boosted state literacy by 5%, and waived property taxes for half of state homeowners. When he tired of the role and decided he needed to move into the Federal government, he transitioned to State Senator and made his way to Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>He continued to receive widespread popularity and was one of FDR’s foremost critics. All eyes were on Long in the weeks building up to the 1936 Presidential election. Huey was estimated to have been able to pull 10% of the popular vote if he ran just as an independent, a staggering amount which could have split the Democratic vote or forced the party to nominate him as their candidate over FDR.</p>
        <p>However, the Kingfish fell in 1935, just before the election, when he was assassinated by an unaffiliated, seemingly disgruntled Louisiana citizen. Details on his assassination are still murky and open to skepticism today, but one fact remains clear: FDR and his supporters viewed Long’s death as a massive relief.</p>
        <p>History doesn’t allow for “what ifs”, but they’re simply too tempting in Huey’s case. What if Huey had run for President? What if he had won? What if he led us through WWII instead of FDR? What would America look like today if his Share Our Wealth bills had passed Congress?</p>
        <p>While all of these are interesting questions, I have one which trumps them all: why don’t most Americans know who Huey Long is, and why did he fade into obscurity despite living and contributing to one of the most widely reviewed and studied periods in World history?</p>
