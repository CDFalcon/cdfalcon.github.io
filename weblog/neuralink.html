        <p><em>04/10/21</em></p>
        
        <p>Two days ago, the San Francisco company <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a> published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsCul1sp4hQ">this video</a> showcasing a monkey with neural implants playing pong with only his brain. Discussion over the video immediately began. Some called it witchcraft, others praised the potential benefits of such technology. Only one thing is certain: no one agrees on the topic.</p>
        <p>Originally, I was preparing to draft an opinion entry on this particular issue. However, I remembered I actually wrote a lengthy research essay on the morals behind cybernetic enhancement as part of my dual enrollment in my senior year of high school. While I finished the essay around 2-3 years ago and I’m certain my opinions have at least slightly changed on the topic due to my current interests in Human Computer Interaction, I parsed through the text and at first glance it appeared to hold up. I would apologize for any noticeable difference in writing quality if I wasn’t completely certain my past self was a better writer than my current. Anyways, here’s <a href="weblog/cybernetics.pdf">the essay</a>.</p>
